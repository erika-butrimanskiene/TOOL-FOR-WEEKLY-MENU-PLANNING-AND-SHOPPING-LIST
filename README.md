# TOOL-FOR-WEEKLY-MENU-PLANNING-AND-SHOPPING-LIST
My individual project, not yet fully implemented. Just with a part of functionality. Will be back-end too.
SHORT DESCRIPTION: A tool for weekly menu planning and shopping list creation.
Based on the selected dishes of the week, a shopping list is generated. List can be adjusted according to the products already available at home, as well as other necessary products that are not included in the dishes can be added to the list. The shopping list is displayed by product categories and when shopping, you can mark an already added product in the cart, which then falls to the bottom of the shopping list.
